###1. Create events and states

State machine is composed of finite number of states and transitions which are triggered via events.

An Event is just a unique type, which will be processed by the state machine.

```cpp
struct my_event { ... };
```

You can also create event instance in order to simplify transition table notation.

```cpp
auto event = sml::event<my_event>;
```

If you happen to have a Clang/GCC compiler, you can create an Event on the fly.

```cpp
using namespace sml;
auto event  = "event"_e;
```

However, such event will not store any data.

----

A State can have entry/exit behaviour executed whenever machine enters/leaves State and
represents current location of the state machine flow.

To create a state below snippet might be used.

```cpp
auto idle = sml::state<class idle>;
```

If you happen to have a Clang/GCC compiler, you can create a State on the fly.

```cpp
using namespace sml;
auto state  = "idle"_s;
```

However, please notice that above solution is a non-standard extension for Clang/GCC.

`SML` states cannot have data as data is injected directly into guards/actions instead.

A state machine might be a State itself.

```cpp
sml::state<state_machine> composite;
```

`SML` supports `terminate` state, which stops events to be processed. It defined by `X`.

```cpp
"state"_s = X;
```

States are printable too.

```cpp
assert(string("idle") == "idle"_s.c_str());
```

###2. Create guards and actions

Guards and actions are callable objects which will be executed by the state machine in order to verify whether a transition, followed by an action should take place.

Guard MUST return boolean value.
```cpp
auto guard1 = [] {
  return true;
};

auto guard2 = [](int, double) { // guard with dependencies
  return true;
};

auto guard3 = [](int, auto event, double) { // guard with an event and dependencies
  return true;
};

struct guard4 {
    bool operator()() const noexcept {
        return true;
    }
};
```

Action MUST not return.
```cpp
auto action1 = [] { };
auto action2 = [](int, double) { }; // action with dependencies
auto action3 = [](int, auto event, double) { }; // action with an event and dependencies
struct action4 {
    void operator()() noexcept { }
};
```

###3. Create a transition table

When we have states and events handy we can finally create a transition table which represents
our transitions.

`SML` is using eUML-like DSL in order to be as close as possible to UML design.

* Transition Table DSL

    * Postfix Notation

    | Expression | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | state + event<e> [ guard ] | internal transition on event e when guard |
    | src\_state / [] {} = dst\_state | anonymous transition with action |
    | src\_state / [] {} = src\_state | self transition (calls on_exit/on_entry) |
    | src\_state + event<e> = dst\_state | external transition on event e without guard or action |
    | src\_state + event<e> [ guard ] / action = dst\_state | transition from src\_state to dst\_state on event e with guard and action |
    | src\_state + event<e> [ guard && (![]{return true;} && guard2) ] / (action, action2, []{}) = dst\_state | transition from src\_state to dst\_state on event e with guard and action |

    * Prefix Notation

    | Expression | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | state + event<e> [ guard ] | internal transition on event e when guard |
    | dst\_state <= src\_state / [] {} | anonymous transition with action |
    | src\_state <= src\_state / [] {} | self transition (calls on_exit/on_entry) |
    | dst\_state <= src\_state + event<e> | external transition on event e without guard or action |
    | dst\_state <= src\_state + event<e> [ guard ] / action | transition from src\_state to dst\_state on event e with guard and action |
    | dst\_state <= src\_state + event<e> [ guard && (![]{return true;} && guard2) ] / (action, action2, []{}) | transition from src\_state to dst\_state on event e with guard and action |

* Transition flow

```
src_state + event [ guard ] / action = dst_state
                                     ^
                                     |
                                     |
                                    1. src_state + on_exit
                                    2. dst_state + on_entry
```

To create a transition table [`make_transition_table`](user_guide.md#make_transition_table-state-machine) is provided.

```cpp
using namespace sml; // Postfix Notation

make_transition_table(
 *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s
, "dst_state"_s + "other_event"_e = X
);
```

or

```cpp
using namespace sml; // Prefix Notation

make_transition_table(
  "dst_state"_s <= *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action
, X             <= "dst_state"_s  + "other_event"_e
);
```

&nbsp;

###4. Set initial states

Initial state tells the state machine where to start. It can be set by prefixing a State with `*`.

```cpp
using namespace sml;
make_transition_table(
 *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s,
  "dst_state"_s + event<game_over> = X
);
```

Initial/Current state might be remembered by the State Machine so that whenever it will reentered
the last active state will reactivated. In order to enable history you just have
to replace `*` with postfixed `(H)` when declaring the initial state.

```cpp
using namespace sml;
make_transition_table(
  "src_state"_s(H) + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s,
  "dst_state"_s    + event<game_over>                   = X
);
```

You can have more than one initial state. All initial states will be executed in pseudo-parallel way
. Such states are called `Orthogonal regions`.

```cpp
using namespace sml;
make_transition_table(
 *"region_1"_s   + event<my_event1> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state1"_s,
  "dst_state1"_s + event<game_over> = X,

 *"region_2"_s   + event<my_event2> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state2"_s,
  "dst_state2"_s + event<game_over> = X
);
```

![CPP(BTN)](Run_Orthogonal_Regions_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/sml/master/example/orthogonal_regions.cpp)
![CPP(BTN)](Run_History_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/sml/master/example/history.cpp)

###5. Create a state machine

State machine is an abstraction for transition table holding current states and processing events.
To create a state machine, we have to add a transition table.

```cpp
class example {
public:
  auto operator()() {
    using namespace sml;
    return make_transition_table(
     *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s,
      "dst_state"_s + event<game_over> = X
    );
  }
};
```

Having transition table configured we can create a state machine.

```cpp
sml::sm<example> sm;
```

State machine constructor provides required dependencies for actions and guards.

```cpp
                            /---- event (injected from process_event)
                            |
auto guard = [](double d, auto event) { return true; }
                   |
                   \--------\
                            |
auto action = [](int i){}   |
                  |         |
                  |         |
                  \-\   /---/
                    |   |
sml::sm<example> s{42, 87.0};

sml::sm<example> s{87.0, 42}; // order in which parameters have to passed is not specificied
```

Passing and maintaining a lot of dependencies might be tedious and requires huge amount of boilerplate code.
In order to avoid it, Dependency Injection Library might be used to automate this process.
For example, we can use [ext Boost.DI](https://github.com/boost-ext/di).

```cpp
auto injector = di::make_injector(
    di::bind<>.to(42)
  , di::bind<interface>.to<implementation>()
);

auto sm = injector.create<sm<example>>();
sm.process_event(e1{});
```

###6. Process events

State machine is a simple creature. Its main purpose is to process events.
In order to do it, `process_event` method might be used.

```cpp
sml::sm<example> sm;

sm.process_event(my_event{}); // handled
sm.process_event(int{}); // not handled -> unexpected_event<int>
```

Process event might be also triggered on transition table.

```
using namespace sml;
return make_transition_table(
 *"s1"_s + event<my_event> / process_event(other_event{}) = "s2"_s,
  "s2"_s + event<other_event> = X
);
```

`SML` also provides a way to dispatch dynamically created events into the state machine.

```cpp
struct game_over {
  static constexpr auto id = SDL_QUIT;
  // explicit game_over(const SDL_Event&) noexcept; // optional, when defined runtime event will be passed
};
enum SDL_EventType { SDL_FIRSTEVENT = 0, SDL_QUIT, SDL_KEYUP, SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP, SDL_LASTEVENT };
//create dispatcher from state machine and range of events
auto dispatch_event = sml::utility::make_dispatch_table<SDL_Event, SDL_FIRSTEVENT, SDL_LASTEVENT>(sm);
SDL_Event event{SDL_QUIT};
dispatch_event(event, event.type); // will call sm.process(game_over{});
```

![CPP(BTN)](Run_Dispatch_Table_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/sml/master/example/dispatch_table.cpp)
![CPP(BTN)](Run_SDL2_Integration_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/sml/master/example/sdl2.cpp)

&nbsp;

---

###8. Handle errors

In case when a State Machine can't handle given event an `unexpected_event` is fired.

```cpp
make_transition_table(
 *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s
, "src_state"_s + unexpected_event<some_event> = X
);
```

Any unexpected event might be handled too by using `unexpected_event<_>`.

```cpp
make_transition_table(
 *"src_state"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "dst_state"_s
, "src_state"_s + unexpected_event<some_event> / [] { std::cout << "unexpected 'some_event' << '\n'; "}
, "src_state"_s + unexpected_event<_> = X // any event
);
```

In such case...

sm.process_event(some_event{}); // "unexpected 'some_event'
sm.process_event(int{}); // terminate
assert(sm.is(X));
```

Usually, it's handy to create additional `Orthogonal region` to cover this scenario,
This way State causing unexpected event does not matter.

```cpp
make_transition_table(
 *"idle"_s + event<my_event> [ guard ] / action = "s1"_s
, "s1"_s + event<other_event> [ guard ] / action = "s2"_s
, "s2"_s + event<yet_another_event> [ guard ] / action = X
// terminate (=X) the Machine or reset to another state
,*"error_handler"_s + unexpected_event<some_event> = X
);
```

We can always check whether a State Machine is in terminate state by.
```cpp
assert(sm.is(sml::X)); // doesn't matter how many regions there are
```

When exceptions are enabled (project is NOT compiled with `-fno-exceptions`) they
can be caught using `exception<name>` syntax. Exception handlers will be processed
in the order they were defined, and `exception<>` might be used to catch anything (equivalent to `catch (...)`).
Please, notice that when there is no exception handler defined in the Transition Table, exception will not be handled by the State Machine.

```cpp
make_transition_table(
 *"idle"_s + event<event> / [] { throw std::runtime_error{"error"}; }
,*"error_handler"_s + exception<std::runtime_error> = X
, "error_handler"_s + exception<std::logic_error> = X
, "error_handler"_s + exception<> / [] { cleanup...; } = X // any exception
);
```

![CPP(BTN)](Run_Error_Handling_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/sml/master/example/error_handling.cpp)

&nbsp;

###9. Test it

Sometimes it's useful to verify whether a state machine is in a specific state, for example, if
we are in a terminate state or not. We can do it with `SML` using `is` or `visit_current_states`
functionality.

```cpp
sml::sm<example> sm;
sm.process_event(my_event{});
assert(sm.is(X)); // is(X, s1, ...) when you have orthogonal regions

//or

sm.visit_current_states([](auto state) { std::cout << state.c_str() << std::endl; });
```

On top of that, `SML` provides testing facilities to check state machine as a whole.
`set_current_states` method is available from `testing::sm` in order to set state machine
in a requested state.

```cpp
sml::sm<example, sml::testing> sm{fake_data...};
sm.set_current_states("s3"_s); // set_current_states("s3"_s, "s1"_s, ...) for orthogonal regions
sm.process_event(event{});
assert(sm.is(X));
```

###10. Debug it

`SML` provides logging capabilities in order to inspect state machine flow.
To enable logging you can use (Logger Policy)(user_guide.md#policies)

```cpp
struct my_logger {
  template <class SM, class TEvent>
  void log_process_event(const TEvent&) {
    printf("[%s][process_event] %s\n", sml::aux::get_type_name<SM>(), sml::aux::get_type_name<TEvent>());
  }

  template <class SM, class TGuard, class TEvent>
  void log_guard(const TGuard&, const TEvent&, bool result) {
    printf("[%s][guard] %s %s %s\n", sml::aux::get_type_name<SM>(), sml::aux::get_type_name<TGuard>(),
           sml::aux::get_type_name<TEvent>(), (result ? "[OK]" : "[Reject]"));
  }

  template <class SM, class TAction, class TEvent>
  void log_action(const TAction&, const TEvent&) {
    printf("[%s][action] %s %s\n", sml::aux::get_type_name<SM>(), sml::aux::get_type_name<TAction>(),
           sml::aux::get_type_name<TEvent>());
  }

  template <class SM, class TSrcState, class TDstState>
  void log_state_change(const TSrcState& src, const TDstState& dst) {
    printf("[%s][transition] %s -> %s\n", sml::aux::get_type_name<SM>(), src.c_str(), dst.c_str());
  }
};

my_logger logger;
sml::sm<logging, sml::logger<my_logger>> sm{logger};
sm.process_event(my_event{}); // will call logger appropriately
```
